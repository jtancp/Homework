### 1. A cash flow is a vector 𝑐 = (𝑐1, 𝑐2, ..., 𝑐𝑛) with positive entries representing payments to you, 
###and negative entities representing payments from you. We follow the convention in
###the BM book and consider, for 𝑖 = 1, ... , 𝑛, the payment 𝑐𝑖 to take place “at the start”
###of period 𝑖. Given a constant interest rate per period 𝑟 > 0, and a cash flow, write a
###function in Julia, call it NPV(c, r), that computes the present value of the cash flow,
###which is given by the expression


c =  [100, 100, 100, 100, 100]
r = 0.05

function NPV(c, r)
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:length(c)
        sum += c[i]/(1+r)^i
    end
    return sum
end

NPV(c, r)




###2. Given a constant interest rate per period 𝑟 > 0 and a cash flow, write a function in Julia,
###NFV_end(c, r), that computes its net future value at the end of period n, which is given
###by the expression
###𝑁 𝐹 𝑉𝑒𝑛𝑑 = 𝑐1(1 + 𝑟)𝑛 + 𝑐2(1 + 𝑟)𝑛−1 + ⋯ + 𝑐𝑛(1 + 𝑟).



###3. Repeat problem 2 above, but now assume that the interest is different from period to
###eriod, and known to be given, in any given period, by the vector 𝑟 = (𝑟1, ... , 𝑟𝑛). The
###interpretation is that, for 𝑖 = 1, ... , 𝑛, the amount 𝑐𝑖(1 + 𝑟𝑖) denotes the value, in period
### + 1, of payment 𝑐𝑖. Call the function NFV_end(c, r).


###4. A wholesaler sells you the flour you need to bake bread in your bakery. If you order less
###than 25 lbs. of flour, they sell you all the flour you order at 80 cents per pound. If you
###order 25 lbs. or more, but less than 250 lbs., they sell you all the flour you order at 70
###cents per pound. If you order 250 lbs. of flour or more, they sell you all the flour you
###order at 60 cents per pound. Write a function in Julia, expense(x), such that, given the
###number 𝑥 of lbs. of flour you want to order, the function returns the total cost of your
###order.


###5. Write code to plot the function expense in Julia, with 𝑥 on the horizontal axis and
###expense(x) on the vertical axis, with 𝑥 ranging from 0 to 300 lbs. (you may use the
###package Plots -or other Julia packages to this effect)
###6. You work for a company for a wage of 𝑤 > 0 per hour. They’re required, by law, to pay
##you “time and a half” for any hour (or fraction of an hour) you work in excess of eight
###hours per day. In any given day, the company is not allowed to hire you for more than
###12 hours. Given an hourly wage, 𝑤, and a number of hours worked in the day, 𝐿 > 0,
##write a function in Julia, call it salary(w,L), that returns how much money you make
