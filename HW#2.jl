### 1. A cash flow is a vector 𝑐 = (𝑐1, 𝑐2, ..., 𝑐𝑛) with positive entries representing payments to you, 
###and negative entities representing payments from you. We follow the convention in
###the BM book and consider, for 𝑖 = 1, ... , 𝑛, the payment 𝑐𝑖 to take place “at the start”
###of period 𝑖. Given a constant interest rate per period 𝑟 > 0, and a cash flow, write a
###function in Julia, call it NPV(c, r), that computes the present value of the cash flow,
###which is given by the expression


c =  [100, 100, 100, 100, 100]
r = 0.05

function NPV(c, r)
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:length(c)
        sum += c[i]/(1+r)^i
    end
    return sum
end

NPV(c, r)




###2. Given a constant interest rate per period 𝑟 > 0 and a cash flow, write a function in Julia,
###NFV_end(c, r), that computes its net future value at the end of period n, which is given
###by the expression
###𝑁 𝐹 𝑉𝑒𝑛𝑑 = 𝑐1(1 + 𝑟)𝑛 + 𝑐2(1 + 𝑟)𝑛−1 + ⋯ + 𝑐𝑛(1 + 𝑟).

function NFV_end(c, r)
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:length(c)
        sum += c[i]*(1+r)^(length(c)-i)
    end
    return sum
end

NFV_end(c, r)


###3. Repeat problem 2 above, but now assume that the interest is different from period to
###eriod, and known to be given, in any given period, by the vector 𝑟 = (𝑟1, ... , 𝑟𝑛). The
###interpretation is that, for 𝑖 = 1, ... , 𝑛, the amount 𝑐𝑖(1 + 𝑟𝑖) denotes the value, in period
### + 1, of payment 𝑐𝑖. Call the function NFV_end(c, r).

function NFV_end(c, r)
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:length(c)
        sum += c[i]*(1+r[i])^(length(c)-i)
    end
    return sum
end


###4. A wholesaler sells you the flour you need to bake bread in your bakery. If you order less
###than 25 lbs. of flour, they sell you all the flour you order at 80 cents per pound. If you
###order 25 lbs. or more, but less than 250 lbs., they sell you all the flour you order at 70
###cents per pound. If you order 250 lbs. of flour or more, they sell you all the flour you
###order at 60 cents per pound. Write a function in Julia, expense(x), such that, given the
###number 𝑥 of lbs. of flour you want to order, the function returns the total cost of your
###order.

function expense(x)
    x <= 25 ? 0.8*x : x <= 250 ? 0.7*x : 0.6*x
end

expense(30)


###5. Write code to plot the function expense in Julia, with 𝑥 on the horizontal axis and
###expense(x) on the vertical axis, with 𝑥 ranging from 0 to 300 lbs. (you may use the
###package Plots -or other Julia packages to this effect)
using Plots 
plot(0:300, expense, label = "Cost", xlabel = "Pounds of Flour", ylabel = "Cost in USD", title = "Cost of Flour")

###6. You work for a company for a wage of 𝑤 > 0 per hour. They’re required, by law, to pay
##you “time and a half” for any hour (or fraction of an hour) you work in excess of eight
###hours per day. In any given day, the company is not allowed to hire you for more than
###12 hours. Given an hourly wage, 𝑤, and a number of hours worked in the day, 𝐿 > 0,
##write a function in Julia, call it salary(w,L), that returns how much money you make
#1 If 𝑤 <0, the function should return “please enter a non-negative hourly wage”.
# If 𝐿 < 0, the function should return “please enter a non-negative number of hours
#worked”.
#If 𝐿 > 12, the function should return “please enter a number of hours worked no greater
#than 12”.

function salary(w, L)
    if w < 0
        return "please enter a non-negative hourly wage"
    elseif L < 0
        return "please enter a non-negative number of hours worked"
    elseif L > 12
        return "please enter a number of hours worked no greater than 12"
    else
        return w*L + (L > 8 ? (L-8)*w*0.5 : 0)
    end
end


##Letting 𝑤 = 20 dollars per hour, write code to plot the function salary, with 𝐿 on the
#horizontal axis and salary(20, L) on the vertical axis, with 𝐿 ranging from 0 to 12
#hours.

w = 20 
using Plots 
plot(0:12, L -> salary(w, L), label = "Salary", xlabel = "Hours Worked", ylabel = "Salary in USD", title = "Salary of a Worker")
